# my_scripts

In this repository you will find short scripts, that help me through the day.
Usually they will not be complicated and you might even find a better
alternative online, but whatever.

## vol

A simple script that gets the volume of your default output device and places
a fontawesome symol in front of it. Use it with dwmblocks for example.

## mic

Same as vol with your default input device.

## audio

This script lets you mange your audio devices via dmenu. It's written in
python.

## bluetoothctlctl

This manages your bluetooth devices via dmenu. It too is crappy and very
incomplete but enough for my usecases.

## bat

Displays battery levels for a two battery setup.

## xp-pen_driver

A script that detects when a xp-pen graphics tablet is plugged in an
automaticly opens the configuration.

## bat_warn

A script, that warns one if the total battery level is less than 15 upon
execution.

## contactman

A contact manager, which uses dmenu and reads from card dav files in the .rolo
folder. rolo is a nice commandline program to manipulate card dav files.

## screenie

Lets you take screenshots using scrot. dmenu asks whether the entire screen
should be selected or a region and whether the screenshot should be copied
or you want to do ocr on it using tesseract. Make sure to change the path to
suit your computer.

## formman

This is a WIP project which is supposed to be able to save often used formulas
and lets you manipulate it using sympy python.
