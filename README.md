# my_scripts

In this repository you will find short scripts, that help me through the day. Usually they will not be complicated and you might even find a better alternative online, but whatever.

## dmenu wrapper

This is just a python wrapper for dmenu. It is used by other scripts.

## notify wrapper

This is a wrapper for the notify-send command. It is used by other scripts.

## dmenu menu

You can create a json file containing keywords and commands as a list of keys and values and run this program on it. I think it is a more convenient way to call custom dmenu prompts.

## friendly reminder

Here you can create a json file containing some information about upcoming meetings etc. which you will be reminded of when you constantly call this script (e.g. using cron). The notify-send command is used for this. It is basically a crappy calender.

## vol

A simple script that gets the volume of your default output device and places a fontawesome symol in front of it. Use it with dwmblocks for example.

## mic

Same as vol with your default input device.

## audio

This script lets you mange your audio devices via dmenu. It's written in quite a crappy style but works. I will have to rewrite this some day

## bluetoothctl

This manages your bluetooth devices via dmenu. It too is crappy and very incomplete but enough for my usecases.

## bat

Displays battery levels for a two battery setup.
